# Ushell
Ushell is a terminal based application it is inspired by a Linux terminal emulator named termux. it's also highly dependent on Java, XML...
because it's made in java
it's still in development.its open source..
install shell.zip instead of source_code.zip 
you can find the whole source in shell.zip...
best regards 👍.
i will try to keep it updated..
and also it's not that much advanced like termux... but it will be advanced soon maybe like termux or even better 
let's see 
...
but first support me because I am a solo dev...
you can call it termux light often ushell.
I will try to keep it updated regularly 🙂.
but there is no guarantee . lol 😆
